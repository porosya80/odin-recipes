    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>butcher's twine</li>
      <li>1 (3 pound) beef tenderloin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut butcherâ€™s twine into 5 or 6 (8-inch) pieces. Wrap each piece firmly
        around the tenderloin, spaced about 1 1/2 inches apart, and secure with
        a knot. Trim off any excess twine. Cut a longer piece of twine and wrap
        it horizontally around the beef; run the ends of the twine under the
        center pieces and tie a firm knot in the center. Trim off any excess.
        Refrigerate tenderloin for 30 minutes uncovered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Set a wire rack
        inside a rimmed baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season tenderloin evenly with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large
        skillet over medium-high heat. Place meat in skillet and cook,
        undisturbed, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on all sides
        until evenly browned. Transfer tenderloin to the prepared wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted
        near the center reaches 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), 35 to 40 minutes
        for medium rare, or cook to desired degree of doneness. Transfer to a
        cutting board to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
